The Mall Navigation App will help users find their way in and around shopping malls across
the world. One of the most frustrating things when you are out shopping in a mall that you do
not frequently visit is finding your way around. We often have to rely on asking for directions
from strangers to shops that we would like to visit. This app will take a blueprint\building plan
of the mall that you are visiting and store it. When visiting a mall, the app will automatically
detect which mall you are in based on your location. As a user, you can enter or search the
name of the shop that you want to visit; the app will then start to navigate you from your
location to where the shop is. The Mall Navigation App will in future be expanded to be used
in airports, hospitals, universities, stadiums and any other large buildings.
